# Gabriel-Pilon
My personal repository
Hello, i am Gabriel Pilon and i am from Brazil.
I am currently a student from the FADERGS faculty, and i am from the digital games course.
I decided to study this course because of the love i have to games. 
For me, video games are a great way to have fun, to de-stress, to relax, and many other things.
I hope that, in the future, i can create my own indie game and to work in games from other companies too.
